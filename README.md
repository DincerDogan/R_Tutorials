# R_Tutorials

To complement my R tutorials on YouTube, this repository contains the R markdown files that contain the scripts I used to produce the visualziations in the videos. Those can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/c/McKayJohns/videos. 

The tutorials included are:

- NBA and NCAA basketball shot charts utilizing the NBA API and ncaahoopR package.
    - The tutorial shows how to create a court, scrape player shot data, and finally plot and customize an aesthetcially pleasing shot chart. The finished products can be seen above in png form!

- Using rvest to scrape baksetball-reference.com and fbref.com and then visualizing relationships using scatter plots.
